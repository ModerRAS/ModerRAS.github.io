The fear of death follows from the fear of life. One who
lives life fully is prepared to die at any time.

Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.

It's a job that's never started that takes the longest to finish.

One man or woman with courage is a majority.

If you set your goals ridiculously high and it's a failure,
you will fail above everyone else's success.

Spend more time smiling than frowning and more time praising than criticizing.

Once you realize how beautiful you are, you will find it
hard to keep the company of those who do not.
